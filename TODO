* expire cookies
* userUpdatePassword :: Cookie -> Password -> IO ()
* userSetCookieExpiration :: Cookie -> TimeDiff -> IO ()
* rename cookies to Credential
* rename account module to Auth
* split out the cookie management into a different module
* keep track of different sets of permissions, full access tied to session cookie
  partial permissions are tied to cookies that expire in 1 year 
  so cookietouser should return a Partial UID or Full UID as the authentication type
  store cookies in a salted hash
